        <h2 id="intro">üìå What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b> which is used for creating web pages
          and
          web
          applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.</p>
        <p><b>Hyper Text:</b> HyperText simply means <i>"Text within Text."</i> A text has a link within it, is a
          hypertext.
          Whenever
          you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to
          link
          two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.</p>
        <p><b>Markup language:</b> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
          conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into
          images, tables, links, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Web Page:</b> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser.
          A
          web
          page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type.<b> With the help
            of
            HTML
            only, we can create static web pages.</b></p>

        <p>Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the
          HTML
          version is given below:</p>

        <ul type="square">
          <li><b>HTML 1.0:</b> The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of HTML
            language, and it was
            released
            in 1991.</li>
          <li><b>HTML 2.0:</b> This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was standard language
            version
            for
            website design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements
            such
            as
            text

            tables
            and providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex
            mathematical
            equations. It became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically
            supported
